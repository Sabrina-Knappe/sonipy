	abstract = {While detailed analyses and spectroscopic follow-up of transient events requires professional experience and access to observing facilities, lightcurve classification - distinguishing between several subtypes of supernovae, or identifying different classes of variable stars - can be accomplished by citizen scientists through template matching and comparisons. In a first for citizen science astronomy, we're moving beyond visual inspection analysis to the sonification of lightcurve data for classification by public volunteers on Zooniverse. Our approach to sonification maps each magnitude data point to a corresponding audible frequency, producing audio files that depict magnitude variations as perceptually uniform changes in pitch through time. Using this method, auditory classification can be applied to lightcurves that vary by up to ∼7 magnitudes, encompassing most known lightcurves for variable
stars, supernovae, and other transient events such as LBV eruptions, while allowing the listener to perceive a minimum difference of
△m=0.02 mags. We present the successfully sonified audio light
curves of a collection of transient phenomena, including a large and diverse sample of supernova lightcurves and test cases for RR Lyrae, LBVs, and short- and long-period eclipsing binaries. We demonstrate that linear and plateau supernova light curves can be audibly differentiated. This approach offers a new method for lightcurve classification and, for the first time, opens citizen science astronomy to participants who are visually impaired. TransientZoo will be launched in the next few years on Zooniverse and will ultimately be optimized and scaled for use with LSST.},
